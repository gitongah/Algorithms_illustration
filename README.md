The first algorithm we shall be looking at is called the binary search algorithm. The binary search algorithm is used to find an element in a sorted list and return the elements index in the list if present. Otherwise it will return null. 
The running time for binary search is O(log n) which is way faster than simple search where the run time of simple search is O(n).
